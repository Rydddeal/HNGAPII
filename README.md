-Run the Project Locally Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project locally by executing:

npm start This will start the server, and it will be running at http://localhost:5000/.

(Optional) Run with nodemon (for development) If you want to automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the code, you can install nodemon and run the project with it:

Install nodemon as a development dependency:

npm install --save-dev nodemon Update your package.json to add a "dev" script under "scripts":

"scripts": { "start": "node index.js", "dev": "nodemon index.js" } Now, you can run the project with: npm run dev
